#### Q1

#### a)
*Show that **the hazard function** is uniquely determined by the **mean residual time $r(t)$**.*

Mean residual time $r(t)$ at time $t$ can be defined as

$$
r(t) = E(X-t\mid X\ge t)=\frac{\int_t^\infty(u-t)f(u)du}{S(t)}
$$

where $f(t)$ is the density function.

We know that the continuous survival function with a finite mean is uniquely determined by the mean residual time as

$$
S(t)=\frac{r(0)}{r(t)}\exp \Big(-\int_0^t \frac{1}{r(u)}du \Big)
$$

Thus, as the hazard function $\lambda(t)$ can be written  


#### b)

Further, show that the exponential distribution is the only continuous distribution for which the mean residual lifetime $r(t)$ is constant for all $t > 0$.
